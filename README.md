## About
Created mostly for students in my school. Thanks to the lack of login requirement ( just username ) everyone can safely send messages from diffrent devices very fast and without inputing password.
## FAQ
### Why no password?
I think everyone needs to communicate in class rooms but no one really wants to login on your social medias so here it is.
### Why firebase on front?
To have it in "static mode" for deployment on github pages.
### Can i have my own version?
Just clone it and change firebase config initialization variable.
